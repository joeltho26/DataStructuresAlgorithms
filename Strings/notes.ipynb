    "- Characteristics of String:\n",
    "    - Ordered\n",
    "    - Indexable\n",
    "    - Comparable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applications:\n",
    "    - Text Processing\n",
    "    - Pattern Matching\n",
    "    - Data Compression (to reduce the amount of storage required to store them eg: String compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and run-length encoding)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "    - Widely Supported\n",
    "        - fundamental data type in most programming languages\n",
    "    - Efficient Manipulation\n",
    "        - Many algorithms and data structures have been developed to efficiently manipulate strings, such as string matching algorithms, string compression algorithms, and data structures like tries and suffix arrays.\n",
