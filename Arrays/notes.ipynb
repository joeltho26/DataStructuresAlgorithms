    "- suppose while creating a list in python, an initial memory size is created of (10 bytes just an example since it varies with python versions and operating systems)\n",

    "    - The extra item fits in spare space.\n",

    "- initially memory (RAM) = 10 bytes is allocated to a list and new items can be added to the list\n",
    "- Once the 10 bytes memory is full, the list memory size is extended by (initial memory + 2 * initial memory => 30 bytes)\n",
    "- the new memory space is allocated (30 bytes) and the values from old memory (10 bytes) space is copied.\n",
    "- Post copying all contents, the initially created 10 bytes memory space is cleared and made available for other tasks."
