The worst-case time complexity of BFS is exponential, O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (the average number of child nodes per node) and d is the depth of the search tree. In the given program, the branching factor is at most 2 (either remove or keep a parenthesis at each position), and the depth can be up to the length of the input string. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of the program is O(2^n), where n is the length of the input string.\n",

The maximum size of the queue can be at most O(2^n), as there can be up to 2^n valid combinations of parentheses. Additionally, the program uses an unordered set to keep track of the visited strings and avoid duplicates. The size of the set can also be up to O(2^n), as each valid combination can potentially be a unique string. Therefore, the space complexity of the program is O(2^n)."
