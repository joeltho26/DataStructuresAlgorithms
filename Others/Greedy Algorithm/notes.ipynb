    "A greedy algorithm decides what to do in each step, only based on the current situation, without a thought of how the total problem looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice in each step, hoping to find the global optimum solution in the end.\n",

    "Two properties must be true for a problem for a greedy algorithm to work:\n",
    "- Greedy Choice Property: \n",
    "    - Means that the problem is so that the solution (the global optimum) can be reached by making greedy choices in each step (locally optimal choices).\n",
    "- Optimal Substructure: \n",
    "    - Means that the optimal solution to a problem, is a collection of optimal solutions to sub-problems. So solving smaller parts of the problem locally (by making greedy choices) contributes to the overall solution."
