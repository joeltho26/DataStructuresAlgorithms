    "- Overall advantages and disadvantages of Linked list:\n",
    "    - <ins>Advantages:</ins>\n",
    "        - Dynamic nature\n",
    "        - Memory efficient (size grows based on requirements and no memory wastage)\n",
    "        - Ease of Insertion and Deletion\n",

    "\n",
    "    - <ins>Disadvantages:<ins>\n",
    "        - Memory usage (uses more memory since address also stored)\n",
    "        - Accessing a node (random access not possible since memory allocation is not continous )\n",
    "        - Search operation costly (since we need to traverse O(n))\n",
    "        - Traversing in reverse order is also expensive\n",
    "\n",
    "    - <ins>Application:<ins>\n",
    "        - Linear data structures such as stack, queue, and non-linear data structures such as hash maps, and graphs can be implemented using linked lists.\n",
    "        - Dynamic memory allocation: We use a linked list of free blocks.\n",
    "        - Implementation of graphs: Adjacency list representation of graphs is the most popular in that it uses linked lists to store adjacent vertices.\n",
    "        - In web browsers and editors like image viewers, music players, etc. uses doubly linked lists to build a forwards and backward navigation button.\n",
    "        - A circular doubly linked list can also be used for implementing data structures like Fibonacci heaps.\n",

    "- Header Linked List\n",
    "    - A header node is a special node that is found at the beginning of the list. A list that contains this type of node, is called the header-linked list. This type of list is useful when information other than that found in each node is needed.\n",
    "    For example, suppose there is an application in which the number of items in a list is often calculated. Usually, a list is always traversed to find the length of the list. However, if the current length is maintained in an additional header node that information can be easily obtained.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    + Grounded Header Linked List\n",
    "        - It is a list whose last node contains the NULL pointer. In the header linked list the start pointer always points to the header node. start -> next = NULL indicates that the grounded header linked list is empty. The operations that are possible on this type of linked list are Insertion, Deletion, and Traversing.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    + Circular Header Linked List\n",
    "        - A list in which last node points back to the header node is called circular linked list. The chains do not indicate first or last nodes. In this case, external pointers provide a frame of reference because last node of a circular linked list does not contain the NULL pointer. The possible operations on this type of linked list are Insertion, Deletion and Traversing.\n",
